      <p>At Nudge, we take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

      <h2>The Short Version</h2>
      <p>We collect the minimum data needed to help you stay in touch with people you care about. We never sell your data, share it with third parties for advertising, or use it for anything other than making the app work for you.</p>

      <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> Used for authentication (sign in with SMS code) and to connect with contacts who also use Nudge.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Names:</strong> The names of people you add to your contact list. We only store names, not phone numbers or other contact details (unless you choose to add them for calling purposes).</li>
        <li><strong>Cadence Preferences:</strong> How often you want to be reminded to reach out to each contact (e.g., weekly, monthly).</li>
        <li><strong>Last Contact Dates:</strong> When you last talked to each person, so we can send timely reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling Information:</strong> Time slots you select for scheduling calls, and confirmed call times.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Push Notification Token:</strong> A unique identifier that lets us send you notifications. This is provided by Apple (iOS) or Google (Android).</li>
        <li><strong>Timezone:</strong> Your device timezone, so we send reminders at appropriate times (not at 3am!).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic information about how you use the app (e.g., when you open it, when you mark a contact as "done"). This helps us improve the app and fix bugs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We don't access your device contacts unless you explicitly choose to import them.</li>
        <li>We don't record or listen to your calls.</li>
        <li>We don't track your location.</li>
        <li>We don't collect data about other apps you use.</li>
        <li>We don't use tracking cookies or analytics from third parties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>

      <p>We use your data solely to provide the Nudge service:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Send Reminders:</strong> To notify you when it's been a while since you talked to someone.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule Calls:</strong> To help you and your contacts find overlapping availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve the App:</strong> To fix bugs, understand what features people use, and make the app better.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> To help you if something goes wrong.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>We will never:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell your data to third parties</li>
        <li>Use your data for advertising</li>
        <li>Share your data with anyone except as required by law</li>
        <li>Send you marketing emails or spam</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Store Your Data</h2>

      <p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase, a trusted backend provider that uses industry-standard encryption and security practices.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Only you can see your contacts and reminders. We use row-level security to ensure users can't access each other's data.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Data is backed up regularly to prevent loss.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

      <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties, except in these limited cases:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use Supabase (database), Expo (push notifications), and cloud infrastructure providers to run the app. These providers have access to data only as needed to perform their services and are bound by confidentiality agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose data if required by law, court order, or government request.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> If you invite someone to Nudge, we'll share the necessary information to connect your accounts (e.g., when scheduling a call together).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>

      <p>You have full control over your data:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access Your Data:</strong> You can view all your data within the app at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Your Data:</strong> You can edit or delete contacts, change preferences, and update your information.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete Your Account:</strong> You can permanently delete your account and all associated data from the app's Settings screen. This action cannot be undone.</li>
        <li><strong>Export Your Data:</strong> Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getnudge.dev">privacy@getnudge.dev</a> to request a copy of your data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you through the app or via email. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page shows when the policy was last revised.</p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>

      <p>We keep your data as long as your account is active. When you delete your account, we permanently delete all your personal data within 30 days. We may retain anonymized usage data for analytics purposes.</p>
