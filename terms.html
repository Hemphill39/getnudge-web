      <h2>5. Notifications and Reminders</h2>

      <p>We are not responsible for failed message delivery due to network issues, device settings, or other factors outside our control.</p>

      <h2>6. Content and Data</h2>

      <h3>Your Content</h3>
      <p>You own the data you put into Nudge (contact names, notes, etc.). By using the app, you grant us permission to store and process this data to provide the service, as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h3>Our Content</h3>
      <p>All Nudge branding, design, code, and other materials are owned by us or our licensors. You may not copy, modify, or distribute them without permission.</p>

      <h2>7. No Warranty</h2>

      <p><strong>Nudge is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.</strong> We do our best to keep the app running smoothly, but we can't guarantee:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>That the app will always be available or error-free</li>
        <li>That reminders will always be delivered on time</li>
        <li>That data won't be lost (though we do regular backups)</li>
        <li>That the app will work perfectly on all devices</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Use Nudge at your own risk. We're not liable if a missed reminder causes you to miss an important call or event.</p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of Nudge, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lost data or missed reminders</li>
        <li>Relationship issues (we hope this doesn't happen!)</li>
        <li>Device damage or data charges</li>
        <li>Any other issues arising from use of the app</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our total liability to you for any claims related to Nudge is limited to the amount you paid us in the past 12 months (currently $0, as Nudge is free).</p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>

      <p>You agree to defend and hold us harmless from any claims, losses, or damages arising from:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your use of Nudge</li>
        <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
        <li>Your violation of any rights of others</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Changes to the Service</h2>

      <p>We may update, modify, or discontinue Nudge at any time, with or without notice. We're not liable if we change or discontinue any part of the service.</p>

      <p>If Nudge is discontinued, we'll do our best to give you reasonable notice and allow you to export your data.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>

      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you through the app or via email. Continued use of Nudge after changes means you accept the new Terms.</p>

      <h2>12. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <p>Nudge integrates with third-party services (e.g., phone/messaging apps for calling). We're not responsible for these third-party services or any issues arising from them.</p>

      <h2>13. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>

      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the state where Nudge is operated, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

      <p>If we have a dispute, let's try to resolve it amicably first. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@getnudge.dev">support@getnudge.dev</a> to discuss any issues.</p>

      <p>If we can't resolve a dispute informally, you agree that any legal action must be brought in the courts located in [Your State/County], and you consent to jurisdiction there.</p>

      <h2>14. Severability</h2>

      <p>If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in effect.</p>

      <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>

      <p>These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Nudge regarding use of the service.</p>
